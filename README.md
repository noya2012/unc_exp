Simulated Video Experiments of Generalized Uncertainty Principle

GUP demonstration experiment is a combination of natural effect and artificial system. From a mechanism point of view, it is a very special experiment. About the random effects of video itself, Its random beat is not artificially designed.

This is an experiment of the principle of uncertainty, which analyses the sources of random effects by minimizing variables. 
Its video itself can be used as an experimental demonstration. See the flow chart in the document for the code section.
