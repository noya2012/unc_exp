Summary
 This experiment explains the cause of nonlinearity and uncertainty, It shows how errors occur in a fully controllable system, and the effect increases with the control process, thus affecting the observation of the system, making the continuously controllable system seem discrete.
Regard on the controllable properties of the system and the relationship between errors helps us a deep understanding of the principle of nonlinearity and uncertainty.

The effects of the principle of uncertainty are demonstrated in many areas. The author found in the accident experiment that the following experimentis is  useful to help understand the principle and interpretation, so the experimental video will be sent here for your reference.

Simulated Video Experiments of Generalized Uncertainty Principle

GUP demonstration experiment is a combination of natural effect and artificial system. From a mechanism point of view, it is a very special experiment. About the random effects of video itself, Its random beat is not artificially designed.

This is an experiment of the principle of uncertainty, which analyses the sources of random effects by minimizing variables. 
Its video itself can be used as an experimental demonstration. See the flow chart in the document for the code section.
